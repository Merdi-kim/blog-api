# Blog api 

This project implements a simple api that contains basic operations(CRUD). It simulates an example of a blog api where users can signup and sign in. They also have features fetch, create, update and delete posts. On top of that, we're implementing validations on signup/signin to avoid having inconsistent data in our database.

To get started with this project, you'll need to do the following:
- Clone the project **git clone https://github.com/Merdi-kim/blog-api.git**
- Navigate into the project **cd blog-api**
- Install the dependencies with **yarn install** or **npm install**
- To start the server, you'll have to do **npm start:dev** or **yarn start:dev**

Feel free to add as many features as you'd like to this project and contribute to make it better(I'd love to see your PR)
